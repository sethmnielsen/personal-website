I have an interdisciplinary background that includes an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering with a Computer Science minor and an MS in Electrical Engineering, where I performed research in navigation and perception in unstructured environments, with a focus on autonomous landing of multirotors and eVTOL aircraft.

My experience includes industry work at a large company and a seed stage startup, internships, engineering competitions, research fellowships, and personal projects. I love working on teams to create things that perform in the real world.

In my work experience, I've ventured into aerospace, where precision and reliability are paramount. Subsequently, I worked at a cutting-edge, fast-paced smart home startup where I built the entire platform for sensing and the automation engine from the ground up.

<h2>Video Highlights</h2>

Here are a few video highlights of my accomplishments.

At Zero Home, I wrote the software for a people-tracking algorithm and designed an array of 50+ radars throughout the home to track where any number of people are in the home at any given time. I also wrote the automations engine that commands lights, sound, touchscreens, and shades as people move about the home. The following videos showcase different scenarios of the automations engine in action:

At the University Rover Challenge, I was the primary engineer for the Autonomous Traversal Task. See my team's rover perform a fully autonomous search, detect and approach for the final goal marker, achieving first place in the task:

Watch the flight of an eVTOL aircraft controlled by PWM commands in a modded version of Microsoft AirSim, for which I was the principal designer:
