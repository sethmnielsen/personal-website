I created a software-in-the-loop simulation tool that combines high-end graphics with real autopilot software to produce a high-fidelity camera and physics simulator, used by other students for research and in a BYU course on quadrotor control.

Investigated the use of various sensors in the autonomous landing of multirotors on arbitrary ships at sea and of eVTOL aircraft in urban environments.
