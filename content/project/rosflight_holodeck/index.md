Created a simulator from scratch, known as `rosflight_holodeck`, that combines high-end graphics with real autopilot software to produce a high-fidelity software-in-the-loop flight and camera simulation for UAVs, now used by other students for research and adopted by a university course to teach vision-based quadrotor control.

Investigated the use of various sensors in the autonomous landing of multirotors on arbitrary ships at sea and of eVTOL aircraft in urban environments.
