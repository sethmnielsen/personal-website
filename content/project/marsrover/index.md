Lead autonomous navigation engineer for the BYU Mars Rover Team: the only team to complete the final, fully autonomous navigation portion of task.

One of the lead operators of the rover throughout development, testing, and competition; implemented much of the team's user interface and networking software.

Wrote code for state machine of obstacle detection and avoidance using lidar and potential field avoidance algorithm.

Trained deep neural network to detect goal markers and adapted it for real-time inference on rover, achieved nearly perfect accuracy during competition.

Implemented controller for GPS waypoint following and vision-based controller to approach within required 2 m radius of goal marker.
